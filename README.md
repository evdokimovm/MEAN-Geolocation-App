# MEAN Geolocation App

This app is fork of my previous [AngularJS Geolocation App](https://github.com/evdokimovm/AngularJS-Geolocation-App)

Previous app use only Wikipedia Data and View on Page. In this new version used Wikipedia API together with Own Node.js API

User now can select point on map and then go to **Add Geo** page to fill form (info about added point **latitude and longitude added to form automatically after select point on map**) and add this point to map
